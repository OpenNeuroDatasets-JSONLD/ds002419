Short-term consumption of sucralose with, but not without, carbohydrate impairs neural and metabolic sensitivity to sugar. Cell Biology. 2020.

##  Study Summary  ##
_______________________________

There is a general consensus that overconsumption of sugar sweetened beverages contributes to the prevalence of obesity and related comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Whether a similar relationship exists for no, or low-calorie “diet” drinks is a subject of intensive debate and controversy. Here, we demonstrate that consuming seven sucralose sweetened beverages with, but not without a carbohydrate over 10 days, decreases insulin sensitivity in healthy human participants; an effect that correlates with reductions in midbrain, insular and cingulate responses to sweet, but not sour, salty or savory taste as assessed with fMRI. Taste perception was unaltered and consuming the carbohydrate alone had no effect. These findings indicate that consumption of sucralose in the presence of a carbohydrate rapidly impairs glucose metabolism and results in longer-term decreases in brain, but not perceptual sensitivity to sweet taste, suggesting dysregulation of gut-brain control of glucose metabolism.

##  Stimulus info  ##
_______________________________
Taste stimuli included a sweet sucrose solution (0.32 M), a sour citric acid solution (0.0056 M), a salty sodium chloride solution (0.14 M), an umami monopotassium glutamate solution (68 mM), and a tasteless and odorless solution.

The sweet, sour, salty, umami, and tasteless stimuli were presented in a block design across two functional imaging runs. During each block, 4 to 8 uncued taste stimulus presentations were presented with a volume of 0.75ml delivered over 2s followed by a 7s swallowing period. Each taste block was presented four times and block length varied between 36 to 54 seconds. The order of blocks was counterbalanced across subjects. Each taste block was followed by a rinsing period (0.75 ml deionized water over 2 seconds). Blocks were separated with a 10 second rest-period.
